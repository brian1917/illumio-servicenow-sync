### UNMANAGED WORKLOADS IS BETA ###

[unmanagedWorkloads]
## Set enable to true to create unmanaged workloads for any server in CMDB table that is not in PCE.
## Current option supports two methods:
# 1) using the cmdb_ci_server_list table to create an unmanaged workload with the ip_address and host_name fields
# 2) using the cmdb_ci_network_adapter table to create an unmanaged workload with an interface for each entry
enable = true 
table = "cmdb_ci_server_list" # "cmdb_ci_server_list.do" or "cmdb_ci_network_adapter"
